How it Works 
-------------
         
Download and Put this in GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons

Open the console and bind a key to "+crysishud"  (Without quotes, don't be stupid)

Like this command
        
              bind mouse3 +crysishud          

Here, when you'll press the middle button of your mouse the QuickMenu (AKA the menu for the modes&shitz) will open
if your head spine as hell, you're running it on a non-allowed mouse gamemode
If it says "Unknow command : +crysishud", reinstall it.

>Network Strings (aka the net. things)


* cloak_stop // used to prevent the usage of NW bools, because fuck off that's why

* cloak_start

* armor_start

* speed_start

* strenght_start

* gry_spawn
