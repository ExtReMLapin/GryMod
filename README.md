Crysis for Garry's Mod

----------
           
**YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RE-UPLOAD IT**
**YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE MONEY USING THIS MOD**


The code is kindda garbage because it's the very first project i worked on
           
           
> **Features:**

> - Crysis 1/Warhead like hud
> - Crysis 1 suit modes (Strength, Speed, Armor, Cloak and shit)
> - Crysis 1 energy system
> - Eyefinity support
> - Auto resizing support (Different monitors format and different sizes, so it will not look like shit)
> - Pseudo-Vectorized textures

           
How it Works 
-------------
         
Download and Put this in GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons

Open the console and bind a key to "+crysishud"  (Without quotes, don't be stupid)

Like this command
        
              bind mouse3 +crysishud          

Here, when you'll press the middle button of your mouse the QuickMenu (AKA the menu for the modes&shitz) will open
if your head spine as hell, you're running it on a non-allowed mouse gamemode
If it says "Unknow command : +crysishud", reinstall it.
