Crysis for Garry's mod
           
         
         
How it Works =====
         
Download and Put this in garrysmod/garrysmodaddons


         Open the console and bind a key to "+crysishud"  (Without quotes, don't be stupid)
         
         
	like this command :  bind mouse3 +crysishud

            
            
 here, when you'll press the middle button of your mouse the QuickMenu (AKA the menu for the modes&shitz) will open
                
            if your head spine as hell, you're running it on a non-allowed mouse gamemode
            
        If it says "Unknow command : +crysishud", reinstall it.

cloak_start

armor_start

speed_start

strenght_start

gry_spawn

gry_jump // used to fix problems, you'll don't need it
