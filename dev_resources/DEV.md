Dev resources
=========

In this folder you can find some of the researches i did on/for grymod.

  - FLA files, sometimes made by me, sometimes made using some 1337h4k3r reverse enginnering sk1llz
  - The .psd used for the firsts versions of grymod (Oh god grymod was terrible when i used PSD
  - Other resources like fonts, used for the vectorized icons

If you wants to use FLA's 'hidden features', you will need :

* [ScaleForm GFx] - Aka , "flash" + "c++" -> Awesomes interfaces.
* [A ScaleForm GFx commercial license] - Well, the last time i used Scaleform i had to lie to get ScaleForm, wait i just checked the website, now you have to pay for a license.
* [Adobe Flash pro] - Because you need to open the FLA file.

Most of the resource here are made by me, feel free to do what you wants with it (Don't make a porn about this) , and if you wants to release a moded version, make a fork, and add me in the credits, and the others peoples who helped.

(Maybe me sentence make no sense , but i'm tired as hell so fuck the police)
